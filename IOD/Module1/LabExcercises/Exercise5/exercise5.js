//For understanding more about arrays, try creating an array that has 5 elements//

let fruitNames = ["Apple", "Pear", "Orange", "Melon", "Banana"];

//Replace the value of the element at position 1 and 4//

//Add a new element to the beginning of the array//

fruitNames.unshift("Coconut");

//Remove the element at the end of the array//
